A daemon for Kubernetes to kill target resources under user-defined templated conditions

## Motivation

In today's fast-paced environments, Kubernetes clusters often manage systems that dynamically create and destroy resources automatically. Examples of these are pipelines and cronjobs. 

However, these automated processes can sometimes get stuck, causing disruptions that affect the smooth operation of the entire system. Often, simply terminating some of these objects can restore normalcy. 

There is a need for a solution that empowers Kubernetes administrators to automate this cleanup process efficiently. 
This project exists to provide a robust agent for automating the deletion of potential stuck resources, 
ensuring your Kubernetes clusters run smoothly and reliably.

## Flags

As every configuration parameter can be defined in the config file, there are only few flags that can be defined.
They are described in the following table:

| Name              | Description                    |    Default    | Example                  |
|:------------------|:-------------------------------|:-------------:|:-------------------------|
| `--config`        | Path to the YAML config file   | `hashrouter.yaml` | `--config ./hashrouter.yaml` |
| `--log-level`     | Verbosity level for logs       |    `info`     | `--log-level info`       |
| `--disable-trace` | Disable showing traces in logs |   `false`     | `--disable-trace`        |

> Output is thrown always in JSON as it is more suitable for automations

```console
hashrouter run \
    --log-level=info
    --config="./hashrouter.yaml"
```

## Examples

Here you have a complete example. More up-to-date one will always be maintained in 
`docs/prototypes` directory [here](./docs/prototypes)


```yaml
version: v1alpha1
kind: hashrouter
metadata:
  name: killing-sample
spec:
  synchronization:
    time: 1m

  resources:

    - target:
        group: ""
        version: v1
        resource: pods

        # Select the resources by their name
        # Choose one of the following options
        name:
          matchRegex: ^(coredns-)
          #matchExact: "coredns-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy"
        
        # Select the namespace where the resources are located
        # Choose one of the following options
        namespace: 
          matchRegex: ^(kube-system)
          #matchExact: kube-system
        
      conditions:

      # Delete the resources when they are older than 10 minutes
      - key: |-
          {{/* Define some variables */}}
          {{- $maxAgeMinutes := 10 -}}

          {{- $nowTimestamp := (now | unixEpoch) -}}
          {{- $podStartTime := (toDate "2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00" .object.status.startTime) | unixEpoch -}}
          
          {{/* Calculate the age of the resource in minutes */}}
          {{- $minutedFromNow := int (round (div (sub $nowTimestamp $podStartTime) 60) 0) -}}
            
          {{/* Print true ONLY if the resource is older than 5 minutes */}}
          {{- printf "%v" (ge $minutedFromNow $maxAgeMinutes) -}}
        value: true

```

> If you detect some mistake on the config, open an issue to fix it. This way we all will benefit

## How to deploy

This project is designed specially for Kubernetes, but also provides binary files 
and Docker images to make it easy to be deployed however wanted

### Binaries

Binary files for most popular platforms will be added to the [releases](https://github.com/achetronic/hashrouter/releases)

### Kubernetes

You can deploy `hashrouter` in Kubernetes using Helm as follows:

```console
helm repo add hashrouter https://achetronic.github.io/hashrouter/

helm upgrade --install --wait hashrouter \
  --namespace hashrouter \
  --create-namespace achetronic/hashrouter
```

> More information and Helm packages [here](https://achetronic.github.io/hashrouter/)


### Docker

Docker images can be found in GitHub's [packages](https://github.com/achetronic/hashrouter/pkgs/container/hashrouter) 
related to this repository

> Do you need it in a different container registry? I think this is not needed, but if I'm wrong, please, let's discuss 
> it in the best place for that: an issue
